# cosmic-vla-automator

Automation for commensal observing with COSMIC at the VLA. The `automator` process is designed to enable commensal observing and SETI search to take place without human intervention.   

At least two modes of operation are required: standard "stop and stare" observing and VLASS-style scanning observations.
